            Thank you for using neubot! You are gaining some understanding
            about your Internet Connection and helping the Internet Community
            to understand what is going on in the network.  This tab provides
            a general overview of the status of the neubot daemon.  Above there
            are a number of tabs, one for each available transmission test.
            Each tab provides more information on the test and allows you to
            review your recent results.

            This is the web interface to control the <em>neubot daemon</em>,

            The following table provides some more details on the state of
            the daemon and highlights the current state.

          <h4>How do I run a test <em>now</em>?</h4>

          <p>The support for starting a test <em>now</em> is not
           yet implemented by this web user interface, but that is
           in the TODO list.  At the moment, the only way to run a
           test <em>now</em> is to type the command <b><em>neubot
           speedtest</em></b> into your favourite shell.</p>
