        <p>In this page we spell out the details of our <a
        href="#policy">privacy policy</a>, in order to comply with
        European law. And we provide a simple <a href="#dashboard">privacy
        dashboard</a> to manage the permissions you give us with
        respect to the treatment of your Internet address, which
        is personal data in EU.</p>

        <h4 id="policy">Privacy policy</h4>

             PRIVACY file, possibly using docutils because PRIVACY

        <p>The purpose of Neubot is to measure the quality and
        neutrality of your Internet connection and to share the
        results with the Internet community, in order to rebalance
        the information asymmetry between ordinary Internet users and
        Service Providers.</p>

        <p>Neubot does not monitor or analyze your Internet traffic. It
        just uses a tiny fraction of your connection capacity to perform
        background transmission tests, sending and/or receiving random
        data.  The result contains the measured performance metrics,
        such as the download speed, or the latency, as well as your
        computer load, as a percentage.  Also, the result contains your
        Internet address.  After the test, the result is uploaded to
        Neubot servers.</p>

        <p>The Neubot project needs to collect your Internet address
        because that allows to infer your Internet Service Provider and
        to have a rough idea of your location.  This is paramount for
        Neubot's goal of monitoring the quality and neutrality of the
        Internet, by provider and geographical area.</p>

        <p>However, in Europe Internet addresses are personal data. So,
        Neubot cannot store, process, or share your Internet address
        without your prior <em>informed consent</em>, under the
        provisions of the &quot;Codice in materia di protezione
        dei dati personali&quot; <a class="reference external"
        href="http://www.garanteprivacy.it/garante/doc.jsp?ID=1311248">(Decree
        196/03)</a>.  In accordance with the law, data controller
        is the director of the <a class="reference external"
        href="http://www.dauin.polito.it">Dipartimento di Automatica
        e Informatica</a> of <a class="reference external"
        href="http://www.polito.it/">Politecnico di Torino</a>.</p>

        <p>Neubot asks you to explicitly assert that you have
        read this privacy policy and to give it the permission to
        collect and share your IP address.  If you don't confirm
        that you have read the privacy policy, Neubot collects
        your Internet address under a special provision, that
        allows researchers to do that <a class="reference external"
        href="http://www.garanteprivacy.it/garante/doc.jsp?ID=1556635">for
        statistical purposes only</a>.  Internet addresses collected
        under this regime will be flagged in a special way, and will not
        be shared with anyone.  They will be treated by the researchers
        authorized by the data controller only.  This data, however,
        will not be of great value for the Internet community, because
        they cannot be shared with and analyzed by other researchers.</p>

        <p>The project needs at least the permission to collect your
        Internet address, because otherwise it cannot process your
        results and publish aggregate data.  If you don't give Neubot
        the permission to share, of course your Internet address will not
        be shared with others, and will be processed by the researchers
        authorized by the data controller only.  Please note that there
        is a great benefit in sharing your Internet address, because that
        allows other researchers to study and criticize Neubot methodology
        and data set.  This will empower the Internet community,
        eventually leading to a better understanding of the Net.</p>

        <p>The data controller guarantees you the rights as per Section
        7 of the above mentioned decree.  Basically, you have total
        control over you personal data, and you can, for example,
        inquire Neubot to remove your Internet address from its data
        sets.  To exercise your rights, please write to Dipartimento
        di Automatica e Infomatica (DAUIN) - Politecnico di Torino -
        Corso Duca degli Abruzzi, 24 - 10129 Torino, ITALY.</p>
