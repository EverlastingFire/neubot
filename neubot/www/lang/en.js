'\n\
Human readable summary\n\
``````````````````````\n\
\n\
Neubot characterizes your connections via active tests that send and receive\n\
random data only. To process and save the results Neubot needs your\n\
permission because they contain your Internet address. And that is personal\n\
data under European and Italian Privacy laws (Decree 196/03). Please, note\n\
that without the permission to save the results Neubot cannot work at all.\n\
\n\
Neubot would also like to publish the raw results, to allow other individuals\n\
and institutions to reuse them for research purposes. Again, that cannot be\n\
done without your consent. While Neubot can work also without the permission\n\
to publish, please consider providing it: there is a great value in allowing\n\
other researchers and netizens to study the results.\n\
\n\
Full privacy policy\n\
```````````````````\n\
\n\
$Privacy-Policy: 2.0$\n\
\n\
Neubot is a research project that aims to study the quality and\n\
neutrality of ordinary users\' Internet connections, to rebalance\n\
the information asymmetry between them and Service Providers.\n\
In particular, Neubot (i) *measures* the quality and neutrality of your\n\
Internet connection and (ii) *collects* the results to study it and\n\
publish _aggregate_ data. Neubot would also like to (iii) *publish*\n\
the _raw_ results, to allow other individuals and institutions to\n\
reuse them for research purposes.\n\
\n\
To *measure* the quality and neutrality of your Internet connection,\n\
Neubot does not monitor or analyze your Internet traffic. It just\n\
uses a fraction of your connection capacity to perform background\n\
transmission tests, sending and/or receiving random data. The result\n\
contains the measured performance metrics, such as the download speed,\n\
or the latency, as well as your computer load, as a percentage, and\n\
*your Internet address*. After the test, the result is uploaded to\n\
Neubot servers.\n\
\n\
The Neubot project needs to *collect* your Internet address because that\n\
allows to infer your Internet Service Provider and to have a rough idea\n\
of your location. Without this information, Neubot cannot accomplish\n\
its goal of studying the quality and neutrality of ordinary users\'\n\
Internet connections.\n\
\n\
The Neubot project would also like to *publish* your Internet address\n\
because there is a great value in allowing other researchers to study\n\
and criticize Neubot methodology and data set. This will empower the\n\
Internet community, eventually leading to a better understanding of the\n\
\'Net.\n\
\n\
Please note that in Europe Internet addresses are personal data. This\n\
means that Neubot cannot store, process or publish your address\n\
without your prior *informed consent*, under the provisions of the\n\
&quot;Codice in materia di protezione dei dati personali&quot; (Decree 196/03)\n\
[1]. In accordance with the law, data controller is the NEXA Center\n\
for Internet &amp; Society, represented by its co-director Juan Carlos\n\
De Martin.\n\
\n\
Neubot asks you (a) to explicitly assert that you are *informed*,\n\
i.e. that you have read the privacy policy, and (b) to give it the\n\
permission to *collect* and (c) *publish* your raw IP address. You must\n\
assert that you are informed and give the permission to collect,\n\
otherwise Neubot cannot work, as explained above. The permission to\n\
publish is optional. If you give it, please note that the published\n\
data *can be reused only* for research (or compatible) purposes.\n\
If you don\'t give it, your Internet address will not be published\n\
on the web as raw data and it will be processed by the researchers\n\
authorized by the data controller only.\n\
\n\
Recent versions of Neubot will prompt you to read the privacy policy\n\
and set the permissions when installing the software. In old versions\n\
of the software, however, the installer does not show you the policy\n\
and does not prompt you to set permissions. You are just kindly\n\
asked to go to the privacy page [2] of the web user interface, read\n\
the policy and set permissions. If you refuse to do that, Neubot\n\
collects your Internet address under special provisions that allows\n\
to collect personal data for &quot;statistical and research purposes only&quot;\n\
(Codice di deontologia e di buona condotta per i trattamenti di dati\n\
personali per scopi statistici e scientifici [3]). Internet addresses\n\
collected under this regime will be flagged in a special way and will\n\
not be shared with anyone. They will be treated by the researchers\n\
authorized by the data controller only.\n\
\n\
The data controller guarantees you the rights as per Art. 7 of the\n\
above mentioned Decree 196/03. Basically, you have total control over\n\
you personal data, and you can, for example, inquire Neubot to remove\n\
your Internet address from its data sets. To exercise your rights,\n\
please write to  or to &quot;Centro NEXA\n\
su Internet &amp; Societa\' c/o Dipartimento di Automatica e Infomatica\n\
(DAUIN) - Politecnico di Torino - Corso Duca degli Abruzzi, 24 -\n\
