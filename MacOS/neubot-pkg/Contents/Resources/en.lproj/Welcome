\f0\fs24 \cf2 Neubot is a research project on network neutrality of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://nexa.polito.it/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 NEXA Center for Internet & Society}} at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.dauin.polito.it/"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Politecnico di Torino}}. The project is based on a lightweight {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.neubot.org/copying"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 open-source}} program that interested users can download and install on their computers. The program runs in background and periodically performs transmission tests with some test servers and with other instances of the program itself. These transmission tests probe the Internet using various application level protocols. The program saves tests results locally and uploads them on the project servers. The collected dataset contains samples from various Providers and allows to monitor network neutrality.}
