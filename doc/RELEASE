#. Build a release using the following commands::

     make release
     sudo ./MacOS/makepkg.py
     Win32/setup.py

   The first command runs on any UNIX operating system and creates
   a Debian and source release.  The second runs on MacOSX and
   creates a MacOS release.  The third runs on Windows only and
   creates a Windows release.

#. Run regression tests.  You need access to a Debian machine
   where you are root and where Neubot is not installed.

#. Install Neubot on a Debian machine and:

     #. make sure it prompts for privacy settings during the
        install;

     #. make sure it prompts for privacy settings after a
        reboot;

     #. make sure that the `speedtest` and `bittorrent`
        commands work properly.

#. Install Neubot on a MacOS machine and:

     #. make sure it prompts for privacy settings during the
        install;

     #. make sure it prompts for privacy settings after a
        reboot;

     #. make sure that the `speedtest` and `bittorrent`
        commands work properly.

#. Install and upgrade Neubot on a Windows machine and:

     #. make sure it prompts for privacy settings during the
        install;

     #. make sure it prompts for privacy settings after a
        reboot;

     #. make sure that the `speedtest` and `bittorrent`
        commands work properly.

#. Read the manual page, make sure it's still relevant and
   that there are no changes to be performed.

#. Make sure that Windows installer is not identified as a
   virus by <http://www.virustotal.com/>.

#. Deploy packages on the releases server using the following
   convenience script::

     ./scripts/publish -r location
     ./scripts/publish -R location

   Where `location` is the place where you have placed the
   release.  The -r form deploys a release candidate, while
   the -R form deploys a stable release.

#. Make sure that Neubot autoupdates on a Debian machine
   where it was already installed.

#. Make sure that Neubot autoupdates on a MacOS machine
   where it was already installed.

#. Read wiki/errata and make sure all entries are still up
   to date with reality.

#. Publish SHA256 sums at wiki/sha256.

#. Deploy the new Neubot version on Measurement Lab.

#. Announce the availability of the new version.

#. Deploy the new Neubot version at the master server and
   make sure it advertises the update via rendezvous.
