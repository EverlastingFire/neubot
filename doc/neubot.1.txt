DESCRIPTION
```````````

Neubot is the network neutrality bot, a lightweight open-source
program that runs in background and periodically performs transmission
tests with some test servers and with other instances of the program
itself. These transmission tests probe the Internet using various
application level protocols. The program saves tests results locally
and uploads them on the project servers. The collected dataset
contains samples from various Providers and allows to monitor network
neutrality.

This is a beta release of neubot that implements just client/server
transmission tests, for HTTP (the *speedtest* command), BitTorrent
(*bittorrent*), and raw TCP (*stream*).

The first form of the command will make sure that neubot *daemon* is
running (and will start it if not), and then will open neubot *web user
interface* directing the default browser to *http://127.0.0.1:9774*.
Note that neubot will not attempt to start a web browser if there is
not an available graphical environment (e.g. **DISPLAY** is not set.)

The second form of the command starts neubot daemon, which will daemonize,
eventually dropping root privileges, and then will routinely connect()
to the *master* server to check for software updates and tests to
be performed. The *interval* parameter could be used to control how
frequently the daemon connects to the master server. The default master
server URI is *http://master.neubot.org/rendezvous*, but it is possible
to specify an alternate *URI*.

The third form of the command starts the master server, which will
daemonize, eventually dropping root privileges, and then will accept()
connections from neubot daemons and will return information on available
software updates and tests to be performed. The configuration of
the master server is specified in the system-wide configuration file
**/etc/neubot/config**, but it is possible to override its settings
using the *-D option* switch, that allows to specify an option in the
format used by the configuration file (see below).

The fourth form of the command prints a subset of the program synopsys
(just the second, third, fourth, and fifth form) and documents briefly
the available options.

The fifth form of the command prints neubot version.

The sixth form of the command prints the available *sub-commands*
list. Indeed, neubot is a modular software and many modules provide
a main() function that could be invoked with arguments. For example,
the *rendezvous* module is the one that implements the second, third,
firth, and fifth form of the command.

The seventh form of the command prints the synopys and documents briefly
the available options of the selected sub-command *command*.

The eight form of the command runs the sub-command *command* with
zero or more *arguments*.

The nineth form of the command runs a speed test, invoking the *speedtest*
sub-command. We include this form here because you might want to start a
speedtest from command line (for more info on the full synopsys of this
command pass it the --help option).

The tenth form of the command runs a raw TCP transmission test that
attempts to download as much data as possible from a remote server
for about ten seconds.  We include this form here because you might
want to start such test from command line (for more info on the full
synopsys of this command pass it the --help option).

The eleventh form of the command runs a BitTorrent transmission test
that attempts to download as much data as possible from a remote server
for about ten seconds.  We include this form here because you might
want to start such test from command line (for more info on the full
synopsys of this command pass it the --help option).

OPTIONS
```````

-D option	Set configuration file option. The accepted format is either
                *name:value* or *name=value* (note that neubot will *strip()*
                name and value and so you can add whitespaces at will).

                FIXME The support for this command line switch is rather
                buggy because it's only possible to specify options defined
                by the *rendezvous* module (other options will be ignored).

                We don't document the accepted options because they're likely
                to change slightly when we'll fix the above mentioned bug, and
                so we think it's better not to make promises here.

-d		Debug mode, don't become a daemon.
--help		Print an help screen and exits.
-n		Just connect once to the master server.
-S		Run the program in server mode.
-T interval	Interval between each rendez-vous.
-V		Print version number and exit.
-v		Run the program in verbose mode.
-x		Just retrieve information but don't run tests.

EXAMPLES
````````

In this section we will follow the well-established convention of
representing the unprivileged user prompt with *$* and the privileged
user prompt with *#*.

Perform a single speedtest:

|
|    $ neubot speedtest

Stop neubot daemon:

|
|    $ neubot stop

Debug neubot, running it in verbose mode and preventing it to become
a daemon:

|
|    $ neubot -v -d

Export results to JSON:

|
|    # neubot database -l > output.json

Track neubot daemon state using the command line:

|
|    $ neubot ui track

It is possible to run neubot from the sources directory without installing
it, e.g.:

|
|    $ ./bin/neubot help

FILES
`````

Neubot could be installed below many different prefixes (the most common
ones being **/usr/local** and **/usr**). In this section of the manual
we assume that it has been installed below **/usr/local**:

/etc/neubot/config
  System-wide configuration file that neubot reads at startup.

/usr/local/bin/neubot
  The neubot program, a simple python script that imports neubot and passes
  the control to **neubot.main** module.

/usr/local/share/neubot/*
  Location where neubot python modules are installed.

/var/neubot/database.sqlite3
  System-wide results database, created when the neubot daemon starts
  for the first time.

In addition, if you run neubot as an unprivileged user:

$HOME/.neubot/config
  User-specific configuration file.

$HOME/.neubot/database.sqlite3
  User-specific results database.
