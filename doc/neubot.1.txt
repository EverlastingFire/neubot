DESCRIPTION
```````````

*Neubot* is a research project on network neutrality of the *NEXA Center
for Internet & Society* at *Politecnico di Torino*.  The general idea
behind Neubot is to deploy to interested users a lightweight computer
program that performs distributed measurements and collects quantitative
data on the behavior of *Internet Service Providers* (ISPs) with respect
to *traffic discrimination* and *Internet access quality*.

This manual page documents the *Neubot Agent*, i.e. the piece of software
that you install on your computer.  Typically, the Agent *runs in the
background* without your intervention, and periodically performs *Tests*
with remote Test Servers and (in future) with other Agents.  Each test
emulates the syntax and/or behavior of a given application protocol and
consists of sending and/or receiving random data only, *i.e. the Agent
does not monitor or analyze your traffic.*

You can configure and control the Agent either via *command line* or
via its *Web User Interface* (WUI).  The Command Line Interface (CLI)
allows to start, stop, and query the Agent status, run on-demand tests,
and much more.  The WUI, based on a *Web API*, permits to configure and
control the Agent, and to navigate recent results.

The *first form* of the command (with no arguments) starts the Web User
Interface in the default browser.  Before opening the browser, this command
ensures that an instance of the Agent is running in background, and starts it
otherwise.
Then, the command tries to open the Web User Interface in the default
browser, using this URI: *http://127.0.0.1:9774/*.  Note that it's not
possible to open a browser if a graphical environment is not available,
i.e. if the *DISPLAY* environment variable is not set.

The *second form* of the command (start) starts the Agent, which will daemonize,
drop privileges if running as root, and then run in the background.
(Note that the Agent drops privileges to the user **_neubot**, so,
if you install Neubot from sources you need to create this user.)
By default, the Agent listens at *127.0.0.1:9774* for Web API requests,
but you can use the optional *address* and *port* arguments to override
the defaults.

The *third form* of the command (status) queries the status of the Agent, and
prints the result on the standard output.  To do that, the command
connects to *127.0.0.1:9774*, and sends a request to the Web API.
The Agent is reported to be running if the response is successful,
i.e. *200 Ok*, and not running otherwise.  You can use the optional
*address* and *port* parameters to query the status of an Agent started
with non-standard address and port.

The *fourth form* of the command (stop) stops the agent, using the proper Web
API command.  Upon receiving this request, the Agent will immediately exit.
You can use the optional *address* and *port* parameters to stop an
Agent started with non-standard address and port.

The *fifth form* of the command (--help) prints on the standard output a brief
help message that summarizes the synopsis.

The *sixth form* of the command (-V) prints on the standard output the version
number.

The *seventh form* of the command (COMMAND) allows to run an arbitrary Neubot
module. The design of Neubot is module-oriented:
most modules export a function, named `main()`, that parses command line options
and implements some behavior.  The available modules are:

agent
  This module implements the Agent behavior described in this manual page.
  I.e. forks in background, starts the Web API server, drops privileges
  if needed, and then periodically performs Tests.  When you run `neubot
  start` this module is invoked under the hood.

bittorrent
  This module performs an on-demand BitTorrent transmission Test with
  an alternative Test Server reserved for this purpose.

database
  This module allows to perform some low-level tasks with the database.
  It allows to dump the content of the database, delete the content of
  the database, remove old entries, and *regenerate the Neubot identifier*
  associated to the Agent.

  (Each Agent is associated with an unique identifier that allows to
  perform time series analysis.  We believe it does not breach your
  privacy, but you might not agree and might want to change it from time
  to time.)

speedtest
  This module performs an on-demand HTTP transmission Test with an
  alternative Test Server reserved for this purpose.

speedtest.client
  Alias for `speedtest`.

stream
  This module performs an on-demand TCP bulk transfer transmission Test
  with an alternative Test Server reserved for this purpose.

The *eight form* (start-neubot-daemon) of the command is a convenience shell
script that attempts to start the Agent in a very robust way.
E.g., if the Python interpreter is not in the **PATH**, the script will try to
locate it.
If you install Neubot from sources, please use this command to start
Neubot from your */etc/rc.local* script.

OPTIONS
```````

-D PROPERTY[=VALUE]  Define the *VALUE* of the given *PROPERTY*.

-E  Ignore *NEUBOT_OPTIONS* environment variable.

-f FILE  Force file name of the database to *FILE*.

-l  List all the available properties and exit.

-v  Verbose: print much more log messages.  

EXAMPLES
````````

In this section we will follow the well-established convention of
representing the unprivileged user prompt with *$* and the privileged
user prompt with *#*.

Run an on-demand HTTP Test:

|
|    $ neubot speedtest

Run an on-demand BitTorrent Test:

|
|    $ neubot bittorrent

Start a system-wide Agent:

|
|    # neubot start

Stop the Agent:

|
|    $ neubot stop

Run the Agent in foreground and in debug mode for debugging purposes:

|
|    $ neubot agent -v -D agent.daemonize=no

Export system-wide results to JSON:

|
|    # neubot database dump > output.json

Track the Agent state using the command line:

|
|    $ neubot api.client

Run Neubot in-place from the sources directory:

|
|    $ ./bin/neubot COMMAND

FILES
`````

Neubot can be installed below many different prefixes (the most common
ones being **/usr/local** and **/usr**). In this section of the manual
we assume that it has been installed below **/usr/local**:

/usr/local/bin/neubot
  The neubot program, a simple python script that imports neubot and passes
  the control to **neubot.main** module.

/usr/local/share/neubot/*
  Location where neubot python modules are installed.

/var/neubot/database.sqlite3
  System-wide results database, created when the neubot daemon starts
  for the first time.

In addition, if you run neubot as an unprivileged user:

$HOME/.neubot/database.sqlite3
  User-specific results database.

BUGS
````

If the default browser is a textual browser and a graphical environment
is available, Neubot will start the web user interface into the
textual browser.  Nine times out of ten this results into an unusable
web user interface because most textual browser do not support
javascript.

Neubot is reported to be "not running" by *neubot start* also when
the response is not *200 Ok*.
