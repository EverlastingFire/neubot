This document briefly explains how the Speedtest test negotiator
interfaces with the generic negotiator code.  For more information
on the generic negotiator code, please refer to the documentation
available at `doc/negotiate/server.txt`.

The Speedtest server uses hash() to map a stream to the related
unique identifier.  Given how the HTTP protocol works, the client
will use such identifier as authorization.  That is the client
adds the authorization header and the server closes the connection
if the connection client does not provide a valid value for such
header or the header is not present.
