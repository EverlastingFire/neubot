This document briefly explains how the BitTorrent test negotiator
interfaces with the generic negotiator code.  For more information
on the generic negotiator code, please refer to the documentation
available at `doc/negotiate/server.txt`.

The BitTorrent server uses str(hash()) to map a stream to the related
unique identifier.  Given how the BitTorrent protocol works, the client
and the server will use the SHA1 of such identifier.  That is, the
client will send SHA1(str(hash(stream))) as the BitTorrent identifier
and the server will allow only know identifiers.
