Neubot, the network neutrality bot
``````````````````````````````````

Neubot is a research project on network neutrality of the NEXA
Center for Internet & Society at Politecnico di Torino. The project
is based on a lightweight open source program that interested users
can download and install on their computers. The program runs in
the background and periodically performs transmission tests with
test servers, hosted by the distributed Measurement Lab platform,
and (in future) with other instances of the program itself.
Transmission tests probe the Internet using various application
level protocols and test results are saved both locally and on the
test servers. The results dataset contains samples from various
Provides and is published on the web, allowing anyone to analyze
the data for research purposes.
