.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBneubot\fP measures quality and neutrality of your Internet connection
in the background.  It performs periodic, active transmission tests with
remote test servers and (in future) with neubot instances installed by
other users.  Tests send and receive random data, emulate different
protocols and measure application\-level metrics, such as latency and
goodput.  Results are saved on the local computer and published on the
web, allowing for better Internet\-access and network\-neutrality research.
Since results contain the user IP address and that is personal data in
the European Union, no test is performed until the user gives \fBneubot\fP
her consent, as explained in the \fI\%PRIVACY\fP section.
.sp
The \fIfirst form\fP of the command (with no arguments) starts \fBneubot\fP
if it is not already running and opens the \fIWeb User Interface\fP in the
default browser.  Note that the browser is not opened: (a) when the
user is \fBroot\fP, for obvious security reasons; (b) when the environment
does not contain the \fBDISPLAY\fP variable, because a graphical browser
is needed.  This form of the command is now \fIdeprecated on UNIX\fP, and
users should use the \fIstart\fP and \fIviewer\fP subcommands to start \fBneubot\fP
and open the Web User Interface respectively.
.sp
The \fIsecond form\fP of the command (\-\-help) prints on the standard output
a brief help message that summarizes the synopsis.
.sp
The \fIthird form\fP of the command (\-V) prints on the standard output the
version number.
.sp
The \fIfourth form\fP of the command (subcommand) allows to run the specified
subcommand.  The remainder of this section documents the most commonly
used subcommands.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B neubot bittorrent [\-v] [\-D setting]
Sends a Web API request (by default to \fI127.0.0.1:9774\fP) to the local
instance of \fBneubot\fP running in the background, asking to run a
bittorrent test immediately.  If it is not possible to communicate
with the local instance, the subcommand will fallback to running the
bittorrent test in its own process context.
.sp
The behavior of this subcommand can be controlled using the following
settings, where the indicated value is the default one:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B agent.api.address=127.0.0.1
Address where the local \fBneubot\fP instance is supposed to
be listening.
.TP
.B agent.api.port=9774
Port where the local \fBneubot\fP instance is supposed to be
listening.
.TP
.B bittorrent.address=""
Address to connect to in order to perform the test (client mode)
or address to listen to (server mode).  When the value equals \fI""\fP,
the subcommand uses \fImaster.neubot.org\fP (client mode) or \fI0.0.0.0\fP
(server mode).
.sp
When running in client mode, this setting is only effective if
the test is run in the process context of the subcommand itself.
.TP
.B bittorrent.daemonize=0
When on (\fInonzero\fP) the subcommand will detach from the current
shell and become a daemon.  When off (\fI0\fP) the subcommand will
run in the context of the current shell.
.sp
When running in client mode, this setting is only effective if
the test is run in the process context of the subcommand itself.
.TP
.B bittorrent.listen=0
Run in client (\fI0\fP) or in server (\fInonzero\fP) mode.
.TP
.B bittorrent.negotiate=1
Turn off (\fI0\fP) or on (\fInonzero\fP) negotiation.  Negotiation is the
procedure that ensures that client and server agree on the test
parameters, and that keeps the server load under control, by
keeping clients in queue and allowing only a subset of them to
perform concurrent tests.
.sp
When running in client mode, this setting is only effective if
the test is run in the process context of the subcommand itself.
.sp
You typically want this setting to be on, unless you are testing
the bittorrent client and server.
.TP
.B bittorrent.negotiate.port=80
The port to be used for negotiation, both for client and for
server mode.
.sp
When running in client mode, this setting is only effective if
the test is run in the process context of the subcommand itself.
.TP
.B bittorrent.port=6881
Port to connect to in order to perform the test (client mode)
or Port to listen to (server mode).
.sp
When running in client mode, this setting is only effective if
the test is run in the process context of the subcommand itself.
.TP
.B runner.enabled=1
When this setting is on (\fInonzero\fP) the subcommand will try to run
the test in the context of the local instance of \fBneubot\fP first,
and then it will fallback to running the test on its own process
context if that fails.
.sp
When this setting is off (\fIzero\fP) the subcommand will always run
the test in its own process context.

with results and allows to perform time serie anlysis.  This action
generates a fresh new random unique identifier.
.TP
.B show
Like \fIdump\fP, but pretty\-prints database content.
.UNINDENT

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B neubot privacy [\-Pt] [\-D setting] [\-f database]
Allows to read privacy policy, test and set privacy settings.  For
more information on privacy see the \fI\%PRIVACY\fP section.  This subcommand
accepts the following command line options:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-D \ setting
Allow to set privacy settings in the database.  The following
privacy settings are defined, along with their default value:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B privacy.informed=""
Turns on (\fInonzero\fP) or off (\fI0\fP) the corresponding privacy
setting in the database, unless the setting is unspecified
(\fI""\fP).
.TP
.B privacy.can_collect=""

.sp
Note that all privacy settings must be on for \fBneubot\fP to be
allowed to run automatic tests.
.sp
Note that this command changes the database, but changes are not
propagated to the \fBneubot\fP instance running in background.
.TP
.BI \-f \ database
Force to use the database at \fIdatabase\fP instead of using the
default one (see \fI\%FILES\fP section for more info).
.TP
.B \-P
Prints privacy policy on the standard output.
.TP
.B \-t

.B neubot speedtest [\-v] [\-D setting]
Sends a Web API request (by default to \fI127.0.0.1:9774\fP) to the local
instance of \fBneubot\fP running in the background, asking to run a
speedtest test immediately.  If it is not possible to communicate
with the local instance, the subcommand will fallback to running the
bittorrent test in its own process context.
.sp
The behavior of this subcommand can be controlled using the following
settings, where the indicated value is the default one:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B agent.api.address=127.0.0.1
Address where the local \fBneubot\fP instance is supposed to
be listening.
.TP
.B agent.api.port=9774
Port where the local \fBneubot\fP instance is supposed to be
listening.
.TP
.B runner.enabled=1
When this setting is on (\fInonzero\fP) the subcommand will try to run
the test in the context of the local instance of \fBneubot\fP first,
and then it will fallback to running the test on its own process
context if that fails.
.sp
When this setting is off (\fIzero\fP) the subcommand will always run
the test in its own process context.
.TP
.B speedtest.uri=uri
URI of the negotiate server to perform the negotiation with.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B neubot start
Starts \fBneubot\fP in the background.  The program will daemonize,
drop privileges (if needed), \fIlisten()\fP for Web API requests (by
default at \fI127.0.0.1:9774\fP), and run periodic tests, if the user has
given her consent.  Typically, this form of the command is invoked by
startup scripts and the user should not need to run it directly.
.TP
.B neubot status
Issues a Web API request (by default to \fI127.0.0.1:9774\fP) to check
whether \fBneubot\fP is running, and prints the result on the standard
output.  When the result is is "not running", it means that either
\fIconnect()\fP failed or the response is not the expected one (meaning that
there isn\(aqt a \fBneubot\fP process listening on that address and port).
.TP
.B neubot stop
Issues a Web API command (by default to \fI127.0.0.1:9774\fP) that forces
\fBneubot\fP to exit.
.TP
.B neubot viewer [\-f file] [\-O option]
Starts a viewer application that embeds the Web User Interface, if
the dependencies are installed.  By default, the viewer connects to
\fI127.0.0.1:9774\fP, but that can be changed specifying an alternate
configuration file or overriding options from command line.
.sp
Accepts the following command line options:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-f \ file
Forces to read settings from \fIfile\fP, instead of using the default
configuration file \fB/etc/neubot/api\fP.  If the file does not
exist or contains errors, this subcommand will ignore it and will
continue with default settings.

The Neubot project is a research effort that aims to study the quality
and neutrality of ordinary users\(aq Internet connections, to rebalance the
information asymmetry between them and Service Providers.  The Neubot
software (i) \fImeasures\fP the quality and neutrality of your Internet
connection.  The raw measurement results are (ii) \fIcollected\fP on the
measurement servers for research purposes and (iii) \fIpublished\fP, to allow
other individuals and institutions to reuse them for research purposes.
.sp
To \fImeasure\fP the quality and neutrality of your Internet connection,
the Neubot software does not monitor or analyze your Internet traffic.
It just uses a fraction of your connection capacity to perform background
transmission tests, sending and/or receiving random data.  The results
contain the measured performance metrics, such as the download speed,
or the latency, as well as your computer load, as a percentage, and
\fIyour Internet address\fP.
.sp
The Internet address is paramount because it allows to \fIinfer your Internet
Service Provider\fP and to have a rough idea of \fIyour location\fP, allowing to
put the results in context.  The Neubot project needs to \fIcollect\fP it
to study the data and wants to \fIpublish\fP it to enable other individuals
and institutions to carry alternative studies and/or peer\-review its
measurements and data analysis methodology.  This is coherent with the
policy of the distributed server platform that empowers the Neubot
project, Measurement Lab (M\-Lab), which requires all results to be
released as open data [1].
.sp
You are reading this privacy policy because Neubot is developed in the
European Union, where there is consensus that Internet addresses are
\fIpersonal data\fP.  This means that the Neubot project cannot store, process
or publish your address without your prior \fIinformed consent\fP, under the
provisions of the "Codice in materia di protezione dei dati personali"
(Decree 196/03) [2].  In accordance with the law, data controller is the
NEXA Center for Internet & Society [3], represented by its co\-director Juan
Carlos De Martin.
.sp
Via its web interface [4], the Neubot software asks you (a) to explicitly
assert that you are \fIinformed\fP, i.e. that you have read the privacy
policy, (b) to give it the permission to \fIcollect\fP and (c) \fIpublish\fP your
IP address.  If you don\(aqt assert (a) and you don\(aqt give the permission
to do (b) and (c), Neubot cannot run tests because, if it did, it would
violate privacy laws and/or Measurement Lab policy.
.sp
The data controller guarantees you the rights as per Art. 7 of the
above\-mentioned Decree 196/03.  Basically, you have total control over
you personal data, and you can, for example, inquire Neubot to remove
your Internet address from its data sets.  To exercise your rights, please
write to <\fI\%privacy@neubot.org\fP> or to "NEXA Center for Internet & Society,
Dipartimento di Automatica e Infomatica, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca
degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Turin, ITALY."

.SH BUGS
.sp
If the default browser is a textual browser and a graphical environment
is available, Neubot will start the web user interface into the
textual browser.  Nine times out of ten this results into an unusable
web user interface because most textual browser do not support
javascript.

Neubot is reported to be "not running" by \fIneubot start\fP also when
the response is not \fI200 Ok\fP.
