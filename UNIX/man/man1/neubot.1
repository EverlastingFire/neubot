.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fINeubot\fP is a research project on network neutrality of the \fINEXA Center
for Internet & Society\fP at \fIPolitecnico di Torino\fP.  The general idea
behind Neubot is to deploy to interested users a lightweight computer
program that performs distributed measurements and collects quantitative
data on the behavior of \fIInternet Service Providers\fP (ISPs) with respect
to \fItraffic discrimination\fP and \fIInternet access quality\fP.
.sp
This manual page documents the \fINeubot Agent\fP, i.e. the piece of software
that you install on your computer.  Typically, the Agent \fIruns in the
background\fP without your intervention, and periodically performs \fITests\fP
with remote Test Servers and (in future) with other Agents.  Each test
emulates the syntax and/or behavior of a given application protocol and
consists of sending and/or receiving random data only, \fIi.e. the Agent
does not monitor or analyze your traffic.\fP
.sp
You can configure and control the Agent either via \fIcommand line\fP or
via its \fIWeb User Interface\fP (WUI).  The Command Line Interface (CLI)
allows to start, stop, and query the Agent status, run on\-demand tests,
and much more.  The WUI, based on a \fIWeb API\fP, permits to configure and
control the Agent, and to navigate recent results.
.sp
The \fIfirst form\fP of the command (with no arguments) starts the Web User
Interface in the default browser.  Before opening the browser, this command
ensures that an instance of the Agent is running in background, and starts it
otherwise.
Then, if the user is not running as root, the command tries to open the Web
User Interface in the default
browser, using this URI: \fIhttp://127.0.0.1:9774/\fP.  Note that it\(aqs not
possible to open a browser if a graphical environment is not available,
i.e. if the \fIDISPLAY\fP environment variable is not set.
.sp
The \fIsecond form\fP of the command (start) starts the Agent, which will daemonize,
drop privileges if running as root, and then run in the background.
(Note that the Agent drops privileges to the user \fB_neubot\fP, so,
if you install Neubot from sources you need to create this user.)
An Agent started like this listens at \fI127.0.0.1:9774\fP for Web API requests.
.sp
The \fIthird form\fP of the command (status) queries the status of the Agent, and
prints the result on the standard output.  To do that, the command
connects to \fI127.0.0.1:9774\fP, and sends a request to the Web API.
The Agent is reported to be running if the response is successful,
i.e. \fI200 Ok\fP, and not running otherwise.
.sp
The \fIfourth form\fP of the command (stop) stops the agent listening at
\fI127.0.0.1:9774\fP, using the proper Web
API command.  Upon receiving this request, the Agent will immediately exit.
.sp
The \fIfifth form\fP of the command (\-\-help) prints on the standard output a brief
help message that summarizes the synopsis.
.sp
The \fIsixth form\fP of the command (\-V) prints on the standard output the version
number.
.sp
The \fIseventh form\fP of the command (COMMAND) allows to run an arbitrary Neubot
module. The design of Neubot is module\-oriented:
most modules export a function, named \fImain()\fP, that parses command line options
and implements some behavior.  The available modules are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B agent
.
This module implements the Agent behavior described in this manual page.
I.e. forks in background, starts the Web API server, drops privileges
if needed, and then periodically performs Tests.  When you run \fIneubot
start\fP this module is invoked under the hood.
.TP
.B bittorrent
.
This module performs an on\-demand BitTorrent transmission Test with
an alternative Test Server reserved for this purpose.
.TP
.B database
.
This module allows to perform some low\-level tasks with the database.
It allows to dump the content of the database, delete the content of
the database, remove old entries, and \fIregenerate the Neubot identifier\fP
associated to the Agent.
.sp
(Each Agent is associated with an unique identifier that allows to
perform time series analysis.  We believe it does not breach your
privacy, but you might not agree and might want to change it from time
to time.)
.TP
.B speedtest
.
This module performs an on\-demand HTTP transmission Test with an
alternative Test Server reserved for this purpose.
.TP
.B speedtest.client
.
Alias for \fIspeedtest\fP.
.TP
.B stream
.
This module performs an on\-demand TCP bulk transfer transmission Test
with an alternative Test Server reserved for this purpose.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-D \ PROPERTY[=VALUE]
.

.BI \-f \ FILE
.
Force file name of the database to \fIFILE\fP.
.TP
.B \-l
.
List all the available properties and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
.
Verbose: print much more log messages.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
In this section we will follow the well\-established convention of
representing the unprivileged user prompt with \fI$\fP and the privileged
user prompt with \fI#\fP.

.nf

.in +2
$ neubot speedtest
.in -2

.nf

.in +2

.SH FILES
.sp
Neubot can be installed below many different prefixes (the most common
ones being \fB/usr/local\fP and \fB/usr\fP). In this section of the manual
we assume that it has been installed below \fB/usr/local\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B /usr/local/bin/neubot
.
The neubot program, a simple python script that imports neubot and passes
the control to \fBneubot.main\fP module.
.TP
.B /usr/local/share/neubot/*
.
Location where neubot python modules are installed.
.TP
.B /usr/local/share/neubot/main/__init__.py
.
Well\-known location of the real main() of Neubot.  This is the
standard entry point to Neubot.
.TP
.B /usr/local/share/neubot/updater/unix.py
.
Well\-known location of the updater daemon for Unix.  This is an
alternative entry point to Neubot.
.TP
.B /var/neubot/database.sqlite3
.
System\-wide results database, created when the neubot daemon starts
for the first time.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition, if you run neubot as an unprivileged user:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B $HOME/.neubot/database.sqlite3
.
User\-specific results database.
.UNINDENT
.SH BUGS
.sp
If the default browser is a textual browser and a graphical environment
is available, Neubot will start the web user interface into the
textual browser.  Nine times out of ten this results into an unusable
web user interface because most textual browser do not support
javascript.
.sp
Neubot is reported to be "not running" by \fIneubot start\fP also when
the response is not \fI200 Ok\fP.
