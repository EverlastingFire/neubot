Human readable summary
``````````````````````

Neubot characterizes your connections via active tests that send and receive
random data only. To process and save the results Neubot needs your
permission because they contain your Internet address. And that is personal
data under European and Italian Privacy laws (Decree 196/03). Please, note
that without the permission to save the results Neubot cannot work at all.

Neubot would also like to publish the raw results, to allow other individuals
and institutions to reuse them for research purposes. Again, that cannot be
done without your consent. While Neubot can work also without the permission
to publish, please consider providing it: there is a great value in allowing
other researchers and netizens to study the results.

$Privacy-Policy: 2.0$

Neubot is a research project that aims to study the quality and
neutrality of ordinary users' Internet connections, to rebalance
the information asymmetry between them and Service Providers.
In particular, Neubot (i) *measures* the quality and neutrality of your
Internet connection and (ii) *collects* the results to study it and
publish _aggregate_ data. Neubot would also like to (iii) *publish*
the _raw_ results, to allow other individuals and institutions to
reuse them for research purposes.

To *measure* the quality and neutrality of your Internet connection,
Neubot does not monitor or analyze your Internet traffic. It just
uses a fraction of your connection capacity to perform background
transmission tests, sending and/or receiving random data. The result
contains the measured performance metrics, such as the download speed,
or the latency, as well as your computer load, as a percentage, and
*your Internet address*. After the test, the result is uploaded to
Neubot servers.

The Neubot project needs to *collect* your Internet address because that
allows to infer your Internet Service Provider and to have a rough idea
of your location. Without this information, Neubot cannot accomplish
its goal of studying the quality and neutrality of ordinary users'
Internet connections.

The Neubot project would also like to *publish* your Internet address
because there is a great value in allowing other researchers to study
and criticize Neubot methodology and data set. This will empower the
Internet community, eventually leading to a better understanding of the
'Net.

Please note that in Europe Internet addresses are personal data. This
means that Neubot cannot store, process or publish your address
without your prior *informed consent*, under the provisions of the
"Codice in materia di protezione dei dati personali" (Decree 196/03)
[1]. In accordance with the law, data controller is the NEXA Center
for Internet & Society, represented by its co-director Juan Carlos
De Martin.

Neubot asks you (a) to explicitly assert that you are *informed*,
i.e. that you have read the privacy policy, and (b) to give it the
permission to *collect* and (c) *publish* your raw IP address. You must
assert that you are informed and give the permission to collect,
otherwise Neubot cannot work, as explained above. The permission to
publish is optional. If you give it, please note that the published
data *can be reused only* for research (or compatible) purposes.
If you don't give it, your Internet address will not be published
on the web as raw data and it will be processed by the researchers
authorized by the data controller only.

Recent versions of Neubot will prompt you to read the privacy policy
and set the permissions when installing the software. In old versions
of the software, however, the installer does not show you the policy
and does not prompt you to set permissions. You are just kindly
asked to go to the privacy page [2] of the web user interface, read
the policy and set permissions. If you refuse to do that, Neubot
collects your Internet address under special provisions that allows
to collect personal data for "statistical and research purposes only"
(Codice di deontologia e di buona condotta per i trattamenti di dati
personali per scopi statistici e scientifici [3]). Internet addresses
collected under this regime will be flagged in a special way and will
not be shared with anyone. They will be treated by the researchers
authorized by the data controller only.

The data controller guarantees you the rights as per Art. 7 of the
above mentioned Decree 196/03. Basically, you have total control over
you personal data, and you can, for example, inquire Neubot to remove
your Internet address from its data sets. To exercise your rights,
please write to  or to "Centro NEXA
su Internet & Societa' c/o Dipartimento di Automatica e Infomatica
(DAUIN) - Politecnico di Torino - Corso Duca degli Abruzzi, 24 -
10129 Torino, ITALY."
