Neubot, the network neutrality bot
``````````````````````````````````

Neubot is a research project of the NEXA Center for Internet & Society,
a research center of Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica (DAUIN),
at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. We develop the network neutrality bot,
a lightweight open-source agent application that performs distributed
Internet QoS measurements using different application-level protocols,
and uploads results to our central servers, to allow constant monitoring
of network neutrality.
