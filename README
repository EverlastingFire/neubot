neubot - The network neutrality bot
```````````````````````````````````

Neubot is a research project of the NEXA Center for Internet & Society,
a research center of Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica (DAUIN) at
Politecnico di Torino.

Neubot is the network neutrality bot.  It silently runs in background
and routinely performs transmission tests with either existing servers
(*client/server* mode) or other running neubot instances (*peer-to-peer*
mode), employing different network protocols, such as **HTTP** and
**BitTorrent**, and measuring relevant QoS parameters. A set of central
servers coordinates these tests, telling each neubot instance which test
should be performed, and collects, analyzes, and publishes the results,
trying to rebalance (at least in part) the deep information asymmetry
regarding network neutrality that exists between ordinary users and
internet service providers.

This is a beta release of neubot that does not implement *peer-to-peer*
mode and performs **HTTP** transmission tests only, using a measurement
methodology inspired to the one of http://www.speedtest.net.
