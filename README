Neubot, the network neutrality bot
``````````````````````````````````

Neubot is a research project on network neutrality of the NEXA
Center for Internet & Society at Politecnico di Torino. The project
is based on a lightweight open-source program that interested users
can download and install on their computers. The program runs in
background and periodically performs transmission tests with some
test servers and with other instances of the program itself. These
transmission tests probe the Internet using various application
level protocols. The program saves tests results locally and uploads
them on the project servers. The collected dataset contains samples
from various Providers and allows to monitor network neutrality.
